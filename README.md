# Atlas Dashboard

> An Operational Dashboard in Elixir and Phoenix

Atlas Dashboard is built on top of [Atlas Platform](https://github.com/chrislaskey/atlas_platform), a collection of production-ready design patterns for Elixir and Phoenix.

## Demo

A container-based demo environment is available. Assuming [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is installed:

```bash
bin/demo/build # Build the demo environment
bin/demo/up # Start the demo environment
bin/demo/stop # Stop the demo environment
bin/demo/remove # Remove the demo environment
```

## Development

Atlas can be used as a pattern reference for an existing application or as a starting point for a new one.

To build a new application using Atlas, see the [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](DEVELOPMENT.md).
